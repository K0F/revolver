# REVOLVER

  Revolver is a digital video synthetiser. It inputs valid c++ code snippet and turning it into a pixel value. Something similar as GLSL is doing on GPU but computed by CPU. 

  _Q: That is crazy.. why would you do that? ..it is so much slower_
  
  _A: Yup, but it is sort of tricky to get 16-bits-per-channel pixel out of your GPU ..and it is much more fun! ;)_

## options:

  - ```-i formula.txt``` setting input program textfile
  - ```-o output.mkv``` setting output videofile

### a formula file
  
  Is basicly the body of C++ function, triggered once for each rendered pixel per frame rendered. There is some preprocessing going on which gives you following variables:

  - ```R``` red pixel value
  - ```G``` green pixel value
  - ```B``` blue pixel value
  - ```max``` default to 65535 which is maximum value in color-range in 16-bit
  - ```x``` x coordinate of current pixel
  - ```y``` y coordinate of current pixel
  - ```frameCount``` number of frames passed
  - ```width``` width of pixel area
  - ```height``` height of pixel area

  Roughly speaking any of valid C++ code is allowed here. For instance you can use math i.e. including ```<math.h>``` functions as well. If you need to extend libraries used by this snippet add them to ```blueprint.h``` file. Defining classes or other functionas are so far out of scope, it is quite easy it extend it if needed.

  If the code is invalid it will prints out compiler error to console.

### optional:

  - ```-s 720x576``` output size
  - ```-f 1998x1080``` actual framesize (adding letterboxes / pilarboxes to ```-s```)
  - ```-r 24000/1001``` or i.e. ```-s 23.97602397602397602397``` to set framerate (defaults on PAL 25)
  - ```-p yuv444p16le``` setting pixelformat of the output (see ```ffmpeg -pix_fmts``` for full list)
  - ```-t 3600``` how much seconds to render i.e. ```-t 01:30:00``` gives 1 hour and half
  - ```-q 1``` do no show live preview (render mode)

## dependencies:

  - ```ffmpeg``` swiss army knife for video
  - ```mpv``` modern videoplayer
  - ```g++``` c++ compiler

## build:

  - ```git clone https://github.com/K0F/revolver```
  - ```cd revolver```
  - ```make```

## run:

  - ```./revolver -i formulas/1.txt -s 4096x2160 -p yuv444p16le -r 24 -o My4kBlockBuster.mkv```
 
  It outputs FFV1 codec in Matro≈°ka container, later you can convert such MASTER into DPX series, DCP or ProRes to use it in whatever professional video editor of your choice.

## compatibility:

  It works on Linux only (MacOs would possibly do as well, untested)
